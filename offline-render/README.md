This folder contains a setup for a docker container running the MOD OS.  
It converts the rootfs generated by buildroot and integrates the plugins built using mod-plugin-builder.  
The result is a container with the OS/system identical to a MOD unit, including jackd, mod-host and mod-ui.

## Instructions

1. Build `mod-os` and `plugins` from mod-live-usb, or alternatively grab [GitHub action builds](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-live-usb/actions/workflows/build.yml) (plugin-bundles and workdir-mod-os)
2. The file `rootfs.ext2` should be placed on this folder (where this readme lives), this is automatically done if building `mod-os` locally
3. Build `plugins` locally or place the `plugin-bundles` actions downloaded content in ../plugins/bundles relative to this readme
4. With the needed files in place, run `./build.sh` to generate the docker image used for offline rendering
5. Run `./run.sh` to start a volatile image instance, which will auto-delete itself after use
6. Place any needed files in the `./output` folder, relative to this readme. This will be accessible inside the docker instance as `/root/output`
7. Send mod-host commands to port 5555 (unix socket), ending with "freewheeling" (see [notes.txt](notes.txt) for a few examples)
8. Once the recording is finished, the docker image instance stops automatically. Find any generated files inside the same `./output` folder
